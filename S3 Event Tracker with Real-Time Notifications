roject Name:
"S3 Event Tracker with Real-Time Notifications"

Project Objective:
Capture every upload, delete, and overwrite action on an S3 bucket, and send real-time notifications via email using AWS SNS.

Architecture Overview:
User Uploads/Deletes/Overwrites ➜ S3 Bucket ➜ Triggers Lambda ➜ Sends SNS Email Notification

Required AWS Services:
S3 – to store files and generate events
SNS – to send email notifications
Lambda – to process S3 events and send notifications
IAM – to grant necessary permissions

Step-by-Step Configuration:
1. Create an S3 Bucket
Name it like: s3-event-monitor-saubhagya
Enable versioning (to detect overwrite)
Enable server access logging (optional for advanced analysis)

2. Create an SNS Topic
Name it: s3-event-notify
Add email subscription (your email)
Confirm the email from your inbox

3. Create IAM Role for Lambda
Allow permissions:
s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject, s3:DeleteObject
sns:Publish
logs:*
Trust policy for Lambda service

4. Create Lambda Function
Runtime: Python 3.12 or Node.js 18
Trigger: S3 Event Notification
Events:
s3:ObjectCreated:*
s3:ObjectRemoved:*
Add environment variable:
SNS_TOPIC_ARN=your-sns-topic-arn

#5. Lambda Function Code (Python)

6. Connect S3 to Lambda
Go to your bucket → Properties → Event notifications → Add
Choose:
Event types: PUT, POST, DELETE
Destination: Lambda function

7. Test It Out
Upload, delete, or overwrite a file in the S3 bucket.
Check your email — you’ll get instant notifications!
